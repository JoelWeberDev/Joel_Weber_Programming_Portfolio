                <h3>My Christian Idenity</h3>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most defining aspect about me is that I am follower of Jesus Christ because He willingly
                    endured the consequence for my failures and mistakes. For this reason, I seek to apply and integrate
                    Jesus's loving and perfect lifestyle into my demeanor and practices. I am amazed as I observe the
                    profound impact that following Jesus has in the lives of others. It inspires me to consider how
                    much accomplished when people in through a common love choose to forgo their differences and work
                    together with a united purpose.       
                </p>

                <h3>Inspiring Others to Achieve</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that there is incredible value when people are inspired to achieve and excel as they go through
                    life. Motivation, however, is difficult to synthesize independently, and is often generated through
                    interpersonal interactions with people who listen and offer insights. Often, I have been the beneficiary
                    of people who are willing to invest their time to help inspire others. So, now I too want to motivate
                    others achieve their goals and transform their dreams into reality.  
                </p>

                <h3>Expanding Knowledge </h3>
                <p>
                    I regard every aspect of life is an opportunity to learn something new regardless of 
                    how menial or insignificant it may seem. Hence, I look to use every task to expand my
                    general competence by maintaining mental engagement in whatever I do. Even while I am 
                    working full time, I devote a portion of my spare time to completing online courses 
                    primarily in computer science, mathematics, and science. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, an old cliche saying states “If you're the smartest person in the room, you are 
                    in the wrong room.” As I converse with others this saying challenges me to identify the 
                    expertise of others and direct the conversation towards those proficiencies rather than 
                    always revolving around my own. Hence, I effectively become the less competent individual 
                    in the room with great potential to learn something new.

                <p>
                    As outlined earlier in the passions section I have a strong desire to inspire others to set ambitious goals and 
                    motivate them to carry them through to completion. I am currently working to lead by example to intentionally
                    inspire others to set and attain goals in the three following areas:

                        <p>
                            I seek to encourage other people to be active and engaged in their faith.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Time is a limited very resource so I want to motivate others to efficeiently manage time through the

                <p>
                    I greatly enjoy developing a system that solves a problem entirely bottom up, from start to finish. Being a freelance
                    developer would allow me to initially assess a problem with a client, complete the problem solving process
                    and finally present a functional and cohesive system that offers a solution. To attain this vision I am currently
                    working to gain ample knowledge and experience relevant to computer science particularly web
                    development and machine learning.

                    I am passionate about computer development and am always looking to strengthen my programming skills.
                    So, I intend to work towards a BCS computer science degree at the University of Waterloo starting in Septermber 2023,
                    and now I am currently preparing by working through relevant projects and online studies.
