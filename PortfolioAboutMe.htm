            <h3>My Christian Idenity</h3>
            <p>
                The most defining aspect about me is that I a follower of Jesus Christ because he willing endured the 
                consequence for my failures and mistakes. For this reason I seek to apply and extrapolate Jesus's loving and perfect 
                life style to how I live also. I am amazed and inspired by what is accomplished when people forego their differences
                through love and work together with a respect for eachother and a united cause.        
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Inspire">
            <h3>Inspiring Others to Achieve</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that there is increadible value when people are inspired to achieve and excel as they go through life.
                This motivation however, is difficult to synthesize independantly, and is often genrated through interacting with
                other people who listen and offer insights. I have often been the beneficiary of people who are willing to invest 
                their time to help inspire me so now I too want to motivate others achieve their goals and transform their ideas
                into reality.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Learning" >
            <h3>Expanding Knowledge </h3>
            <p>
                I regard every aspect of life is an opportunity to learn something new regardless of how menial or insignicant it 
                may seem hence I try to maintain mental engagement in whatever I do. I devote a portion of my spare time to 
                working through online courses pertaining primarily to computer science, mathematics, and science. As I Interact 
                with others I am careful to limit the extent of what I say to instead listen and learn from their thoughts and
                ideas.

            <p>
                As outlined earlier in the passions section I have a strong desire to inspire others to set ambitious goals and 
                motivate them to carry it through to completion. I am currently working lead by example to intentionally
                inspire others to set and attain goals in the three following areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="headers">The Christian Faith</h3>
                    <p>
                        I seek to encourage other people to be active and engaged in their faith.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h3 class="headers">Managing Time Effectively</h3>
                    <p>
                        Time is a limited very resource so I want to motivate others to efficeiently manage time through the 
                        ways that I use my own time.

                        I want to help others get into software development and use the increadible online resources available.
                    </p>

            <h2 class="headers">Freelance Development</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoy developing a system to solve a problem bottom up, from start to finish. Being a freelance
                developer would allow me to initially assess a problem with a client, complete the problem solving process
                and finally present a functional and cohesive system with the solution. To attain this vision I am currently
                working to gain an expansive amount of relevant knowledge and experience that covers most crucial aspects of 
                developing a complete computerized system. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="school">
            <h2 class="headers">Computer Science Degree</h2>
            <p>
                I am passionate about computer development am always looking to strengthen my programming skills understanding.
                So, I plan to work towards a BCS computer science degree at the University of Waterloo starting in Septermber 2023,
                and now I am currently preparing and working through self guided studies to optimize my chances to be accepted 
                into the program.
