                    <p>
                        Since early 2020 I have been researching how computer vision has and can be integrated into agricultural
                        systems to increase precision and opertion efficiency. I am currently working to develop a system that 
                        can detect crop rows from video and guide a weeding implement accordingly. This project is still in 
                        perliminary stages, but I currenlty have a model that can identify crop rows in most situations.

                        The rise of expansive open source online code and online resources has enabled me to learn
                        increadible amounts about software development through self guided studies. I taught myself 
                        basics of python programming which then was expanded on throughout a high school computer 
                        science course. I also have a well versed background in manipulating primarily Arduino, ESP and 
                        Raspberry Pi PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) through C++ and Python platforms. I to learn 
                        the coding syntax and techiques I use SoloLearn where I have completed the following courses:

                        As is essential for learning I pushed myself to experiment and attempt to apply new concepts. The projects
                        shown below are a sample of my smaller projects in spare time and assignments from some of my
                        computer related courses.

                                This is a simulation that calculates the rate at which a tire will inflate based on 
                                supply pressure and flow rate. The interface is designed to implement more variables
                                in the future to optimze the simulation accuracy.

                                primarily entailed designing and making the core mechanics and the way the different objects
                                within the game are managed.

                    <p>
                        I resently decided that a functional understanding of website development would be a useful skill to posess.
                        There are many versitle web dev tools like wordpress and squarespace, however I felt that if I wanted to 
                        fully understand a website I would have to delve into the foundational HTML, CSS and Javascript. Therefore
                        I developed this website entirely bottom up in a text editor rather than an assistive API. It took me about
                        a month of working evenings on this project to develop something presentable, but I now have a solid foundational
                        undersanding of backend website development.
