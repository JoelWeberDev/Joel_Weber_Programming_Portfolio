Personal Interests redesigned
- My Engineering Principles
    - Test driven product development is important because it gives emerical data about its reliability, short comings, and desired results.
    - When engineering I follow a sandbox driven approach where I always open and configure a sandbox environment where I can quicky explore ideas and questions in a low stakes environment.
    - I believe that taking ample time to setup and configure an engineering workspace is like buying high quality equipment; it has a larger initial cost, but will have a significant payoff in the long term.
- As demonstrated in my past work and projects I am passionate about building technoloy to make a measurable differnece in many fields such as agriculture, manufacturing, aviation, the web, and cutting edge research. 
- I am a Christian meaning ... I seek to live a life that is consistent with the life of Jesus and his teaching.
- When travelling or in spare time I enjoy reading books or listening to podcasts about philosophy, technology, religion, engineering, and physics.


Visions
- Bringing more scientific research such as (physics, chemistry, and biology) into the tech industry.
    - From my academic background in both computer science and physics I am a first hand witness of the fruits that are grown at the boundaries between disparate disciplines. New discoveries in quantum mechanics improve semiconductor development and much of the early work in AI was done by physicists. My dream is work at the edge knowledge in scientific research in physics, chemistry, and biology with the fecundity of technology to create new physical systems able to solve complex problems.
- Start a buisiness in agricultural technology
    - In 8th grade I started working part time at a farm and since then my work and many of my projects have in some way been involved in agriculture. More recently I have been enamoured by the prospect of applying technology to optimize agriculture. I am using my project in crop row recognition along with my background in embedded systems to start a business in developing new agricultural technology. 
- Do more research in the physical aspects of quantum computing

## Recent Projects

I have been given incredible opportunities to develop and participate 
in a wide range of projects in engineering and computer science. These
projects have fueled a passion and desire not only to learn more, but 
also to design, develop, and create clever tech products to assist other
industries such as agriculture and manufacturing to better collect and
use data to better manage
