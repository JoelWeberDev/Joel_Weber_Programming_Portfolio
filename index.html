<!-- Naming discrepencies
    IMPORTANT!! Ensure that when using these shortcuts the element where it is being implemented has a unique id
- resp: titles an element as responsive for a specific feature and hence it will change st differeing sizes
- marg: indactor that there is margin that will be set by a javascript funtion based on the specific screen resolution 
- dupe: this is followed by parantheses that indacate something to be duplicated to child elements
- dupeRec: the reciever for the feature to be duplicated
- txtFt: Make the text fit to the container rather than a retaining a defined size
- standard: Works with changeRec to make set a parent relative to the dimension of the standard class
- changeRec: Is the recipient of the dimension parameters of the standard class
- txtSet: This specifies that some form of paramters are going to be imposed upon the content text and will be handled with javascript-->

                        Richard Feynmann the pioneer of quantum electrodynamics famously quipped,
                        "What I cannot create, I cannot undertand." Similarly when I learn a new 
                        topic I go and build the thing that I am trying to understand. In my
                        project portfolio I give a timeline of learning along my engineering path
                        emphasized by some of the major things I have built and understood.

                        I am not programming, I love to play sports, go back country camping, concoct quirky gadgets, listen 
                        to podcasts and explore Ontario. Furthermore, I am a person who loves God desires to represent 
                        Christ in every aspect of my life.

                        As an early developer just discovering the power of computer science, I seek to maintain initiative 
                        in challenging tasks while employing a strong sense of discipline to carry a project through to 
                        completion. Projects like building a functional webpage to training a machine learning models to 
                        recognize soybeans forced me to learn new skills and estalbish a big picture understanding of the
                        systems that I am working with.

                        I love ideas, whether simple or complex, outrageous or grounded I will
                        gravitate towards them. However, what I enjoy still more than a good 
                        idea is to bring a thought to life through building them. Some particular
                        engineering sandboxes where I play include, agricultural technology, robotics,
                        computer vision, physics, mathematical modelling and web development to name 
                        a few. When it comes to engineering I am not only afraid to try, but I also 
                        value the grit required to see a project through until absolute failure or 
                        success.

                        My profession of engineering in computer science and physics is founded upon
                        much hands on experience and a strong practical basis. Throughout highschool 
                        I worked long hours as farm hand. Then I worked as a technician installing high 
                        pressure air systems on farm equipment. After high school I chose to spend a year
                        working as an HVAC technician before university. From this experience I have seen 
                        the value that simple, commonsense engineering can bring to
                        the consumer and the technicians servicing the products that I build.
